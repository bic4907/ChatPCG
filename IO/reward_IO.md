## PCG Agent Reward Function Generation Task
You are a reward function engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
The PCG agent is an agent that balances the game environment by adjusting the setting of the game variables related to the game difficulty.
The adjustable variables are health, armor, and speed of the player agents and range, cooldown, and damage of the players's attack skill.
The action of the PCG agent revise the player property value, which is one of four players, to balance the game difficulty and the reward function evaluates the game difficulty based on the playtested results.
The state of the agent is current game setting values and the action is adjustment of the game setting values.
On every episode, the game setting values are initialized randomly and the PCG agent adjusts the game setting values to achieve the target win rate.
The agent gets the reward signal from the reward function you write and learns to adjust the game setting values to achieve the goal of the reward function.

## The Raid Game Environment
The game environment is a multiplayer game where player agents fight against a boss agent (i.e., boss raid game).
There are four ally player agents and one boss agent in the game and the goal of the player agents is to defeat the boss agent.
On the beginning of the simulation, the game setting values are deployed to the game environment and the player agents and the boss agent are spawned at random locations on the map.
Next, the environment starts game and repeats the game by an arbitrary number (e.g., 100) of episodes to simulate the deployed game settings.
On the end of the simulation, the environment collects, calculates, and store the playtested results via an output file.

## Random Playtesting Output
On the every step of the PCG agent, the environment simulate the game and leaves playtested results.
We sampled playtesting result for five simulations of random skill parameters.
You can use this values to tune the weights of each parameter and scale reward value.

## Variable Reference
In this section, the variables that the reward function can access are described.
The reward function only can access the key listed below. If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.
The common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.
The individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.

## Individual Variables
Playtesting.Agent{i}.SurviveTime - The survival time of Agent {i} during playtesting.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Distance.Moved.PerSecond - The average distance moved per second by Agent {i}.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Distance.Boss.Mean - The average distance of Agent {i} from the boss entity.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Damage.Dealt.PerSecond - The average damage dealt per second by Agent {i}.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Damage.Taken.PerSecond - The average damage taken per second by Agent {i}.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Armored.PerSecond - The change in armor status per second for Agent {i}.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Health.Last.Ratio - The ratio of Agent {i}'s last health value to its maximum health.
Playtesting.Agent{i}.Skill.Used.PerSecond - The average usage of the specific skill per second by Agent {i}.

The playtested values are min-max normalized for each variable. The values are normalized to the range of [0, 1].
There are four player agents in the game and the index of the player agent is from 0 to 3. (e.g., Agent0, Agent1, Agent2, Agent3)
The example of the key name is "Playtesting.Agent0.SurviveTime" for the survival time of Agent0.

## Reward Function
The reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.
The function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.

```python
import json
import sys
import numpy as np


def compute_reward(kwarg):
    reward = 0.0

    # start of code

    # end of code

    return reward


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        json_path = sys.argv[1]

        with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
            kwarg = json.load(f)

        reward = compute_reward(kwarg['Current'])
        print(reward)
    except IndexError:
        print("Error: No argument provided.")
```

This is the template of the reward function. The function receives the playtested results and returns the reward value in float.
The function should be implemented in the "compute_reward" function.
The reward shaping code should be written between '# start of code' and '# end of code' comments.
The code output should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

## Task
Your task is to generate a reward function for the PCG agent which works in the Raid environment.
In order to maximize the fun of multiplayer games, it is possible to express different roles for the four players being generated.
The goal is to find insights that can diversify roles between four player agents and write code that measure how the roles of the four agents (Agent0, 1, 2, and 3) clearly distinct.
Note that the PCG agent revises the game setting of one of the player agents in round-robin manner.
Accordingly, the reward function should evaluate the playtesting result and compare the improvement with previous result.

You can design factors to generate the reward function, and properly sum them up to get the final reward.
Utilize values of the playtesting results on the implementation of the design factors.
For stability of learning, design the reward to be returned in the range [0,1].

## Example Code
Here is the example of the reward function which minimizes the error between target (State.Target.WinRate) and current win rate (Playtesting.WinRate).
The function measure the decrease/increase of the error by comparing the previous and current winrate error.
```python
import json
import sys
import numpy as np


def compute_reward(kwarg):
    reward = 0.0

    # start of code

    def evaluate_result(kwarg) -> float:
        # Dictionary usage example
        # kwarg['State.Agent0.Property.Health.Max']
        # kwarg['Playtesting.Agent1.Skill0.Used.PerSecond']

        return 0.0 # Return the float value

    diversity = evaluate_result(kwarg)

    # Calculate the improvement
    reward += diversity

    # end of code

    return reward


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        json_path = sys.argv[1]

        with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
            kwarg = json.load(f)

        reward = compute_reward(kwarg['Current'])
        print(reward)
    except IndexError:
        print("Error: No argument provided.")
```

## Insights
- As it's a multiplayer game and we want different roles for each player, it would be good to evaluate each parameter individually and contrast it against the others to see how different they are. I propose to measure this difference using the standard deviation method, as it measures dispersion. 
- Variables that can measure different roles are: "SurviveTime", "Damage.Dealt.PerSecond", "Distance.Boss.Mean", "Skill.Used.PerSecond".
- Agents with a higher "SurviveTime" can be seen as tanks, absorbing damage and surviving for a long time.
- Agents dealing a good amount of "Damage.Dealt.PerSecond" can be seen as DPS (Damage Per Second) or damage dealers in the team.
- Agents with "Distance.Boss.Mean" lower are likely to be melee fighters, while players with higher values can be ranged attackers.
- Agents that uses more "Skill.Used.PerSecond" can be seen as supports, as they are actively using skills which could likely be crowd control or healing abilities.
- The reward is the average of the standard deviations of these 4 parameters. We need all of the agents to have different roles to maximise the diversity, and a higher standard deviation implies greater diversity.

## Reward function:
```python
import json
import sys
import numpy as np

def compute_reward(kwarg):
    reward = 0.0

    # start of code

    # list of interest variables
    var_list = ['SurviveTime', 'Damage.Dealt.PerSecond', 'Distance.Boss.Mean', 'Skill.Used.PerSecond']

    std_devs = []
    # iterate over var_list 
    for var in var_list:
      # create a values list for that variable, across all agents
      var_values = []
      for i in range(4):  # four agents
          key = f'Playtesting.Agent{i}.{var}'
          var_values.append(kwarg[key])
      # calculate standard deviation and append to the std_devs list
      std_devs.append(np.std(var_values))
        
    # calculate reward = average of std_devs
    reward = np.mean(std_devs)

    # end of code

    return reward

## PCG Agent Reward Function Generation Task
You are a reward function engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
The PCG agent is an agent that balances the game environment by adjusting the setting of the game variables related to the game difficulty.
The adjustable variables are health, armor, and speed of the player agents and range, cooldown, and damage of the players's attack skill.
The action of the PCG agent revise the player property value, which is one of four players, to balance the game difficulty and the reward function evaluates the game difficulty based on the playtested results.
The state of the agent is current game setting values and the action is adjustment of the game setting values.
On every episode, the game setting values are initialized randomly and the PCG agent adjusts the game setting values to achieve the target win rate.
The agent gets the reward signal from the reward function you write and learns to adjust the game setting values to achieve the goal of the reward function.

## The Raid Game Environment
The game environment is a multiplayer game where player agents fight against a boss agent (i.e., boss raid game).
There are four ally player agents and one boss agent in the game and the goal of the player agents is to defeat the boss agent.
On the beginning of the simulation, the game setting values are deployed to the game environment and the player agents and the boss agent are spawned at random locations on the map.
Next, the environment starts game and repeats the game by an arbitrary number (e.g., 100) of episodes to simulate the deployed game settings.
On the end of the simulation, the environment collects, calculates, and store the playtested results via an output file.

## Variable Reference
In this section, the variables that the reward function can access are described.
The reward function only can access the key listed below. If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.
The common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.
The individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.

## Individual Variables
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.SurviveTime - The survival time of Agent {i} during playtesting.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Distance.Moved.PerSecond - The average distance moved per second by Agent {i}.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Distance.Boss.Mean - The average distance of Agent {i} from the boss entity.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Damage.Dealt.PerSecond - The average damage dealt per second by Agent {i}.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Damage.Taken.PerSecond - The average damage taken per second by Agent {i}.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Armored.PerSecond - The change in armor status per second for Agent {i}.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Health.Last.Ratio - The ratio of Agent {i}'s last health value to its maximum health.
- Playtesting.Agent{i}.Skill.Used.PerSecond - The average usage of the specific skill per second by Agent {i}.

The playtested values are min-max normalized for each variable. The values are normalized to the range of [0, 1].
There are four player agents in the game and the index of the player agent is from 0 to 3. (e.g., Agent0, Agent1, Agent2, Agent3)
The example of the key name is "Playtesting.Agent0.SurviveTime" for the survival time of Agent0.

## Reward Function
The reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.
The function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.

```python
import json
import sys
import numpy as np


def compute_reward(kwarg):
    reward = 0.0

    # start of code
    def reward_1(kwarg):
        return 0.0

    def reward_2(kwarg):
        return 0.0

    def reward_3(kwarg):
        return 0.0


    reward = reward_1(kwarg) + reward_2(kwarg) + reward_3(kwarg)
    # end of code

    return reward


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        json_path = sys.argv[1]

        with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
            kwarg = json.load(f)

        reward = compute_reward(kwarg)
        print(reward)
    except IndexError:
        print("Error: No argument provided.")
```

This is the template of the reward function.
The 'compute_reward' function is composed by summing the results from multiple reward terms, such as reward_1, reward_2 ...
Similar to the template provided, it is necessary to create functions within the function, and the number of functions does not matter.
The function receives the playtested results and returns the reward value in float.
The function should be implemented in the "compute_reward" function.
The reward shaping code should be written between '# start of code' and '# end of code' comments.
The code output should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

## Task
Your task is to fix the generated reward function for the PCG agent which works in the Raid environment.
In order to maximize the fun of multiplayer games, it is possible to express different skills for the four players being generated.
The goal is to find insights that can diversify the parameter of four player agents and write code that measure how the skill and stats of the four agents (Agent0, 1, 2, and 3) clearly distinct.
Note that the PCG agent revises the game setting of one of the player agents in round-robin manner.
Accordingly, the reward function should evaluate the playtesting result and compare the improvement with previous result.

We will provide the reward function code that was previously created.
Additionally, we will input the sampled playtesting results into this reward function and give result reward and data.
You should analyse reward function using the reward and data, and write an updated version of the reward function.
Adding or removing nested functions, modifying them, and adjusting the weights of each reward are all possible.
For stability of learning, design the reward to be returned in the range [0,1].

## Previous Code

            diversity_range = np.ptp(values)
            max_diversity_range = 1  # Since values are normalized to [0, 1], max range is 1
            normalized_diversity = diversity_range / max_diversity_range  # Normalize diversity to [0, 1]
            diversity_scores.append(normalized_diversity)

        # Instead of averaging, take the minimum diversity score. This ensures that all metrics must have some diversity.
        total_diversity = np.min(diversity_scores)

        balance = 1 - ((survival_time_balance + damage_dealt_balance) / 2)

        return balance

    reward = np.clip(reward, 0, 1)

## Insights
- The `diversity_score` function in the previous reward function seems to be the part that requires the most urgent update. The average value of the diversity score is significantly low (0.146895947095) with a notable standard deviation [0.05775963746209108]. This indicates that the diversity across players isn't being effectively encouraged or measured, resulting in a low variation in the gameplay experience among players.
- The method used for calculating diversity (taking the minimum of normalized differences in skill usage, movement, distance moved per second, etc.) could be overly punitive, potentially discouraging diversity by focusing on the least diverse aspect. To encourage a more diversified gameplay experience among players, the method for calculating diversity could be adjusted to better reflect differences across a broader range of gameplay aspects without overly penalizing the total diversity score for lower diversity in a single area.

        # This change aims to better reward scenarios where there's considerable diversity in at least some aspects.
        metrics = ['Skill.Used.PerSecond', 'Distance.Moved.PerSecond', 'Damage.Dealt.PerSecond', 'Damage.Taken.PerSecond']

            diversity_scores.append(normalized_diversity)

        # Calculating the mean diversity score to appreciate overall diversity rather than penalizing based on the least diverse metric.
